# Problem Statement
you have to write a code that will accept an input() as integer from user.

If input is +ve:
keep printing and subtracting 1 from number until 0 is printed.

If input is -ve:
keep printing and adding 1 to number until 0 is printed

If input is 0:
print "already zero"

note: you have to print each output in seperate line

# Solution
```python test.py  -r 'python test.py'
